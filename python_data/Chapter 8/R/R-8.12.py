Draw an arithmetic expression tree that has four external nodes, storing
the numbers 1, 5, 6, and 7 (with each number stored in a distinct external
node, but not necessarily in this order), and has three internal nodes, each
storing an operator from the set {+,−,×, /}, so that the value of the root
is 21. The operators may return and act on fractions, and an operator may
be used more than once.
