Our definition of the level numbering function f(p), as given in Section
8.3.2, began with the root having number 0. Some authors prefer
to use a level numbering g(p) in which the root is assigned number 1, because
it simplifies the arithmetic for finding neighboring positions. Redo
Exercise R-8.18, but assuming that we use a level numbering g(p) in
which the root is assigned number 1.
