Let T be a binary tree with n nodes, and let f() be the level numbering
function of the positions of T, as given in Section 8.3.2.
a. Show that, for every position p of T, f(p) ≤ 2**n −2.
b. Show an example of a binary tree with seven nodes that attains the
above upper bound on f(p) for some position p.
