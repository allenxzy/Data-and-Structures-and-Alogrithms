"""
Design algorithms for the following operations for a binary tree T:
• preorder_next(p): Return the position visited after p in a preorder
traversal of T (or None if p is the last node visited).
• inorder_next(p): Return the position visited after p in an inorder
traversal of T (or None if p is the last node visited).
• postorder_next(p): Return the position visited after p in a postorder
traversal of T (or None if p is the last node visited).
What are the worst-case running times of your algorithms?
