"""
Let T be a binary tree with n positions, and, for any position p in T, let dp
denote the depth of p in T. The distance between two positions p and q
in T is dp +dq âˆ’2da, where a is the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of p
and q. The diameter of T is the maximum distance between two positions
in T. Describe an efficient algorithm for finding the diameter of T. What
is the running time of your algorithm?
