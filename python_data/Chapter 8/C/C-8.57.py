Let T be a binary tree with n positions. Define a Roman position to be
a position p in T, such that the number of descendants in p’s left subtree
differ from the number of descendants in p’s right subtree by at most 5.
Describe a linear-time method for finding each position p of T, such that
p is not a Roman position, but all of p’s descendants are Roman.
