"""
Given a proper binary tree T, define the reflection of T to be the binary
tree T' such that each node v in T is also in T'
, but the left child of v in T
is v’s right child in T' and the right child of v in T is v’s left child in T'
.
Show that a preorder traversal of a proper binary tree T is the same as the
postorder traversal of T’s reflection, but in reverse order.
