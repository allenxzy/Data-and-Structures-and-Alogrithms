Algorithm preorder draw draws a binary tree T by assigning x- and ycoordinates
to each position p such that x(p) is the number of nodes preceding
p in the preorder traversal of T and y(p) is the depth of p in T.
a. Show that the drawing of T produced by preorder draw has no pairs
of crossing edges.
b. Redraw the binary tree of Figure 8.22 using preorder_draw
