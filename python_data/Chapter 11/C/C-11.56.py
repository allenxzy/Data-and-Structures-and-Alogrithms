The standard splaying step requires two passes, one downward pass to
find the node x to splay, followed by an upward pass to splay the node
x. Describe a method for splaying and searching for x in one downward
pass. Each substep now requires that you consider the next two nodes
in the path down to x, with a possible zig substep performed at the end.
Describe how to perform the zig-zig, zig-zag, and zig steps
