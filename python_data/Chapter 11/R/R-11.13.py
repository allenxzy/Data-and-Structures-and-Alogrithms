"""
The rules for a deletion in an AVL tree specifically require that when the
two subtrees of the node denoted as y have equal height, child x should be
chosen to be “aligned” with y (so that x and y are both left children or both
right children). To better understand this requirement, repeat Exercise R-
11.11 assuming we picked the misaligned choice of x. Why might there
be a problem in restoring the AVL property with that choice?
