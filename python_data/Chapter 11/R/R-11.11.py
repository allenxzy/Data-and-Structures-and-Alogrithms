Give a schematic figure, in the style of Figure 11.13, showing the heights
of subtrees during a deletion operation in an AVL tree that triggers a trinode
restructuring for the case in which the two children of the node denoted
as y start with equal heights. What is the net effect of the height of
the rebalanced subtree due to the deletion operation?
