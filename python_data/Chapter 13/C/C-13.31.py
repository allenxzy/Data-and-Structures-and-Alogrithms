"""
In the art gallery guarding problem we are given a line L that represents
a long hallway in an art gallery. We are also given a set X =
{x0,x1,...,xnâˆ’1} of real numbers that specify the positions of paintings
in this hallway. Suppose that a single guard can protect all the paintings
within distance at most 1 of his or her position (on both sides). Design
an algorithm for finding a placement of guards that uses the minimum
number of guards to guard all the paintings with positions in X.
