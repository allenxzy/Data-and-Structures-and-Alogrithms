"""
Let P be a convex polygon, a triangulation of P is an addition of diagonals
connecting the vertices of P so that each interior face is a triangle.
The weight of a triangulation is the sum of the lengths of the diagonals.
Assuming that we can compute lengths and add and compare them in constant
time, give an efficient algorithm for computing a minimum-weight
triangulation of P.
