Anna has just won a contest that allows her to take n pieces of candy out
of a candy store for free. Anna is old enough to realize that some candy is
expensive, while other candy is relatively cheap, costing much less. The
jars of candy are numbered 0, 1, ..., mâˆ’1, so that jar j has nj pieces in
it, with a price of cj per piece. Design an O(n + m)-time algorithm that
allows Anna to maximize the value of the pieces of candy she takes for
her winnings. Show that your algorithm produces the maximum value for
Anna.
