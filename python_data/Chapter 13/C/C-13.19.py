"""
The count method of Pythonâ€™s str class reports the maximum number of
nonoverlapping occurrences of a pattern within a string. For example, the
call abababa .count( aba ) returns 2 (not 3). Adapt the brute-force
pattern-matching algorithm to implement a function, count brute(T,P),
with similar outcome.
