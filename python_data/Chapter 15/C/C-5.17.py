"""
Suppose we are given a sequence S of n elements with integer keys such
that some elements in S are colored “blue” and some elements in S are
colored “red.” In addition, say that a red element e pairs with a blue
element f if they have the same key value. Describe an efficient externalmemory
algorithm for finding all the red-blue pairs in S. How many disk
transfers does your algorithm perform?
