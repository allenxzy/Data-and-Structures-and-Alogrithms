"""
For sets S and T, the syntax SË†T returns a new set that is the symmetric
difference, that is, a set of elements that are in precisely one of S or
T. This syntax is supported by the special__xor__method. Provide an
implementation of that method in the context of the MutableSet abstract
base class, relying only on the five primary abstract methods of that class.
