"""
Although keys in a map are distinct, the binary search algorithm can be
applied in a more general setting in which an array stores possibly duplicative
elements in nondecreasing order. Consider the goal of identifying the
index of the leftmost element with key greater than or equal to given k.
Does the_find index method as given in Code Fragment 10.8 guarantee
such a result? Does the_find_index method as given in Exercise R-10.21
guarantee such a result? Justify your answers.
