"""
Perform a comparative analysis that studies the collision rates for various
hash codes for character strings, such as various polynomial hash codes
for different values of the parameter a. Use a hash table to determine
collisions, but only count collisions where different strings map to the
same hash code (not if they map to the same location in this hash table).
Test these hash codes on text files found on the Internet.
