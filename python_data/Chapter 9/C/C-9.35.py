"""
Given a heap T and a key k, give an algorithm to compute all the entries
in T having a key less than or equal to k. For example, given the heap of
Figure 9.12a and query k = 7, the algorithm should report the entries with
keys 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 (but not necessarily in this order). Your algorithm
should run in time proportional to the number of entries returned, and
should not modify the heap
