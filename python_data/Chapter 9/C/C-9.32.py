Assume that we are using a linked representation of a complete binary
tree T, and an extra reference to the last node of that tree. Show how to
update the reference to the last node after operations add or remove_min
in O(logn) time, where n is the current number of nodes of T. Be sure
and handle all possible cases, as illustrated in Figure 9.12.
