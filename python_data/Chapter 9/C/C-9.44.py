Given a class, PriorityQueue, that implements the minimum-oriented priority
queue ADT, provide an implementation of a MaxPriorityQueue class
that adapts to provide a maximum-oriented abstraction with methods add,
max, and remove_max. Your implementation should not make any assumption
about the internal workings of the original PriorityQueue class,
nor the type of keys that might be used
