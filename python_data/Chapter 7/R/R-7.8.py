Describe a nonrecursive method for finding, by link hopping, the middle
node of a doubly linked list with header and trailer sentinels. In the case
of an even number of nodes, report the node slightly left of center as the
“middle.” (Note: This method must only use link hopping; it cannot use a
counter.) What is the running time of this method?
