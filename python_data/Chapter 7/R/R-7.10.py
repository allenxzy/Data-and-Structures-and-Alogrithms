There seems to be some redundancy in the repertoire of the positional
list ADT, as the operation L.add_first(e) could be enacted by the alternative
L.add_before(L.first( ), e). Likewise, L.add_last(e) might be performed
as L.add_after(L.last( ), e). Explain why the methods add first
and add last are necessary
