Would you use the adjacency matrix structure or the adjacency list structure
in each of the following cases? Justify your choice.
a. The graph has 10,000 vertices and 20,000 edges, and it is important
to use as little space as possible.
b. The graph has 10,000 vertices and 20,000,000 edges, and it is important
to use as little space as possible.
c. You need to answer the query get_edge(u,v) as fast as possible, no
matter how much space you use.
