"""
An Euler tour of a directed graph G with n vertices and m edges is a
cycle that traverses each edge of G exactly once according to its direction.
Such a tour always exists if G is connected and the in-degree equals the
out-degree of each vertex in G . Describe an O(n+m)-time algorithm for
finding an Euler tour of such a directed graph G .
