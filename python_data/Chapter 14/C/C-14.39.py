Suppose we wish to represent an n-vertex graph G using the edge list
structure, assuming that we identify the vertices with the integers in the set
{0,1,...,nâˆ’ 1}. Describe how to implement the collection E to support
O(logn)-time performance for the get_edge(u,v) method. How are you
implementing the method in this case?
