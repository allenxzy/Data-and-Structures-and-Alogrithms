Consider a diagram of a telephone network, which is a graph G whose vertices
represent switching centers, and whose edges represent communication
lines joining pairs of centers. Edges are marked by their bandwidth,
and the bandwidth of a path is equal to the lowest bandwidth among the
pathâ€™s edges. Give an algorithm that, given a network and two switching
centers a and b, outputs the maximum bandwidth of a path between a
and b
