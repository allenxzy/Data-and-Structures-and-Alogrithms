"""
A company named RT&T has a network of n switching stations connected
by m high-speed communication links. Each customer’s phone is directly
connected to one station in his or her area. The engineers of RT&T have
developed a prototype video-phone system that allows two customers to
see each other during a phone call. In order to have acceptable image
quality, however, the number of links used to transmit video signals between
the two parties cannot exceed 4. Suppose that RT&T’s network is
represented by a graph. Design an efficient algorithm that computes, for
each station, the set of stations it can reach using no more than 4 links
