Say that a maze is constructed correctly if there is one path from the start
to the finish, the entire maze is reachable from the start, and there are no
loops around any portions of the maze. Given a maze drawn in an n√ó n
grid, how can we determine if it is constructed correctly? What is the
running time of this algorithm?
