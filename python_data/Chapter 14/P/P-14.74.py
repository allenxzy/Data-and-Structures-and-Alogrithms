"""
Use an adjacency matrix to implement a class supporting a simplified
graph ADT that does not include update methods. Your class should include
a constructor method that takes two collections—a collection V of
vertex elements and a collection E of pairs of vertex elements—and produces
the graph G that these two collections represent.
