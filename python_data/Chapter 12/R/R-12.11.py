Suppose function inplace_quick_sort is executed on a sequence with duplicate
elements. Prove that the algorithm still correctly sorts the input
sequence. What happens in the partition step when there are elements
equal to the pivot? What is the running time of the algorithm if all the
input elements are equal?
