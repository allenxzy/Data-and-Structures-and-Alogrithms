Linda claims to have an algorithm that takes an input sequence S and
produces an output sequence T that is a sorting of the n elements in S.

a. Give an algorithm, is_sorted, that tests in O(n) time if T is sorted.
b. Explain why the algorithm is sorted is not sufficient to prove a particular
output T to Linda’s algorithm is a sorting of S.
c. Describe what additional information Linda’s algorithm could output
so that her algorithm’s correctness could be established on any
given S and T in O(n) time
