Suppose we are given an n-element sequence S such that each element in S
represents a different vote for president, where each vote is given as an integer
representing a particular candidate, yet the integers may be arbitrarily
large (even if the number of candidates is not). Design an O(nlogn)-
time algorithm to see who wins the election S represents, assuming the
candidate with the most votes wins.
