"""
We can make the quick-select algorithm deterministic, by choosing the
pivot of an n-element sequence as follows:
Partition the set S into n/5 groups of size 5 each (except possibly
for one group). Sort each little set and identify the median
element in this set. From this set of n/5 ‚Äúbaby‚Äù medians, apply
the selection algorithm recursively to find the median of the
baby medians. Use this element as the pivot and proceed as in
the quick-select algorithm.
Show that this deterministic quick-select algorithm runs in O(n) time by
answering the following questions (please ignore floor and ceiling functions
if that simplifies the mathematics, for the asymptotics are the same
either way):
a. How many baby medians are less than or equal to the chosen pivot?
How many are greater than or equal to the pivot?
b. For each baby median less than or equal to the pivot, how many
other elements are less than or equal to the pivot? Is the same true
for those greater than or equal to the pivot?
c. Argue why the method for finding the deterministic pivot and using
it to partition S takes O(n) time.
d. Based on these estimates, write a recurrence equation to bound the
worst-case running time t(n) for this selection algorithm (note that in
the worst case there are two recursive calls‚Äîone to find the median
of the baby medians and one to recur on the larger of L and G).
e. Using this recurrence equation, show by induction that t(n) is O(n).
