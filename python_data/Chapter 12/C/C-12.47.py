"""
Bob has a set A of n nuts and a set B of n bolts, such that each nut in A
has a unique matching bolt in B. Unfortunately, the nuts in A all look the
same, and the bolts in B all look the same as well. The only kind of a
comparison that Bob can make is to take a nut-bolt pair (a,b), such that a
is in A and b is in B, and test it to see if the threads of a are larger, smaller,
or a perfect match with the threads of b. Describe and analyze an efficient
algorithm for Bob to match up all of his nuts and bolts
